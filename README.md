# DAA_Asmt_2
In this assignment, we find the maximum number of base pair matchings possible in an RNA sequence.

`draw_rna-master/example_files/rna.cpp` contains the core dynamic programming logic used to find the maximum number of base pair matchings and the corresponding pairs.

`draw_rna-master/example_files/notebook_demo.ipynb` takes an input RNA sequence as a string and outputs an image to visualise the base pair matchings computed.
